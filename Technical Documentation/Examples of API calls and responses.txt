Here are examples of API calls and responses for the ChatGPT integration in the Python Flask web application:

Example 1: API Call
```
POST /v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
  ]
}
```

Example 1: API Response
```
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "chatcmpl-6p9XYPYSTTRi0xEviKjjilqrWU2Ve",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677649420,
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 56, "completion_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 87},
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The capital of France is Paris."
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the user's question is "What is the capital of France?" The API call includes a system message indicating that the assistant is a helpful assistant, followed by the user's message. The API response provides a response generated by the ChatGPT model, with the assistant's message containing the answer "The capital of France is Paris."

The application extracts and displays the generated response on the results page for the user to see.
