To successfully set up install and run the Python Flask web application there are a few steps to follow. 
1. First and foremost ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. If you do not have it yet no need to worry as you can easily download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org). 

2. Once done with the above step, the next thing to do is clone the GitHub repository that contains the application code using this command:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```
Remember to replace `<repository_url>` with your GitHub repository URL. 
3. After cloning, navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository in either a terminal or command prompt. 

4. Then go ahead and create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to isolate all of your applications dependencies by running:
```
python -m venv venv
```

To activate this virtual environment:
   - For Windows users:
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - For macOS/Linux users:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

These steps should help you set up your Python Flask web application without any problem. Ready for some serious advanced technology? 

Then lets go! 

5. The fifth step is installing required Python packages via "pip install -r requirements.txt". 
6. Next head over to OpenAI and acquire an API key after following their informative documentation. 
7. Once you've taken these necessary steps its time launch the Flask application locally via "python app.py". 
8. You should be able to access its homepage by using a web browser and navigating over to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" after doing so. 
    All that remains is inserting your new (unique) ChatGPT generated API key where it belongs in provided file 'app.py' â€“ specifically replacing "'YOUR_API_KEY'." After doing so watch as this cutting edge chatbot AI begins interpreting complex conversational contexts with ease!
